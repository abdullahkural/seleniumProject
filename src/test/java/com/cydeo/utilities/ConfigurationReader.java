/*
Let’s create our utility method
Reading one time is good, but we need to create a re-usable utility method, so we can read from our ".properties" file whenever we want.
    1. Create a new class: "ConfigurationReader"
    2. Copy/paste our ".properties" file reading logic
    3. Edit if needed
    4. Create a new utility method to "re-use" our logic
    5. Method should accept “key” as a String, and return “value” as String
